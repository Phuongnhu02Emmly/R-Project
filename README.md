## investment decisions
The determinants of investment decisions among corporations. Researchers have extensively explored factors such as Earnings Before Taxes (EBT), Net Annual Growth Rate (NAGR), Equity (EQUITY), and Return on Assets (ROAA) to gain insights into the decision-making processes of companies. These factors provide valuable indicators of financial performance, growth prospects, and ownership structure, which can significantly influence investment decisions.
## Data collection and input
To conduct our analysis, we obtained a comprehensive dataset from Vietstock covering the period from 2012 to 2022, measured on a quarterly basis. This dataset includes information on EBT, NAGR, EQUITY, and ROAA for CTCP DNP Holding. By examining these variables, we aim to identify the key factors that have influenced CTCP DNP Holding's investment decisions during the specified period. In addition, the data also includes the target variable, which is the INVESTMENT calculated from the Cost of Capital/Total Assets formula.
